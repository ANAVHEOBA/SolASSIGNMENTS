why solidity

- **solidity** : why is solidity like this, going through the c++ codebase to try to understand why they made some designs and i am yet to figure it out cause i need to know that to understand solidity very well, hopefully i am able to go through it finish before this week(which means that one has to read for at least 17 hours a day)
